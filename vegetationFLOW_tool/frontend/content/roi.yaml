  This is where your journey begins! 
  The ROI Data Collection page is your starting point for your analysis. 
  Here, you'll define the specific areas you want to analyse, 
  whether it's for vegetation health, fire damage, or anything in between.

  We have made it relatively simple to collect and manage your regions of interest. 
  Follow these steps to get started:

step_1:
  - Look at the interactive map in the center of the page.
  - To draw a new area, simply click on the drawing tools located on the map.
  - Click on the map to start drawing your shape. Try to be as close to your interest area
  - For more precise drawing, zoom in on the map!

step_2:
  - Once you've drawn a shape, a small text input box will appear asking you to name it. 
  - Give your region a clear and descriptive name (e.g., "Forest_Area_1", "Burn_Severity_Zone_A", "Healthy_Field_North").
  - This will help you easily identify your regions later on!

step_3:
  - Click the "Download GeoJSON" button to save all your drawn regions as a GeoJSON file to your computer. 
  - This file contains the precise location and names of your areas.
  - You'll need this file for the next steps in the app, like training your models or downloading specific satellite images!
